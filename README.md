# Echoes: Wastelands

An impossibly difficult rage platformer that I helped create as part of one of my first collaboratively developed games on my bachelors degree.

This game was created in C# with Unity.

You can launch the game by running "Game 2.exe" in the [build folder](https://github.com/flyscript/Game2/tree/master/Beta%203.0/build)
