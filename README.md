# Echoes: Wastelands

An impossibly difficult rage platformer that I helped create as part of one of my first collaboratively developed games on my bachelors degree.

This game was created in C# with Unity.

You can launch the game by running "Game 2.exe" in the [build folder](https://github.com/flyscript/Game2/tree/master/Beta%203.0/build)


### Key Features:
* [Triggerzone-activated](https://github.com/flyscript/Echoes-Wastelands/tree/master/Beta%203.0/Assets/Scripts/Environment) falling hazards
* An unused but powerful [camera system](https://github.com/flyscript/Echoes-Wastelands/blob/master/Beta%203.0/Assets/Scripts/Camera/CameraBehaviour.cs) that allows for many player tracking behaviours such as lock-tracking, box-pushing, and boundary-snapping
* A custom-made [camera shake system](https://github.com/flyscript/Echoes-Wastelands/blob/master/Beta%203.0/Assets/Scripts/Camera/ScreenShake.cs) 
* A robust [key-mapping system](V:\GitHub\Game2\Beta 3.0\Assets\Scripts\Input) that tracks key data like button press time, length of button presses, and allows for many physical keys to be mapped to a virtual key to minimise user effort in mapping actions to code.
